## Overview ##
The Long Range Transportation Plan: Sustainable Choices 2045 provides multiple
opportunities for public involvement during the planâ€™s development. CUUATS staff
advertise these opportunities via the Champaign County Regional Planning
Commission website and local news outlets. For the 2045 LRTP, public outreach
efforts include an online interactive map tool, a social media presence, and an
outreach table at popular community events. Public involvement aids in educating
the public about the long range transportation planning process, raising
awareness of existing transportation services, and in providing provisions for
the public to inform the direction of planning efforts. Special emphasis is
placed on public input because the LRTP affects every resident, employee, and
visitor in the community. To gain local support and produce a plan that is
grounded in a shared vision for the future, all resident participation is
welcomed and appreciated.

## Phase One Public Outreach ##
**June 2018 to October 2018**  
The first round of public outreach took place between June and October of 2018.
CUUATS staff prepared a table for the public at seventeen community events
during the initial outreach session. During this period, public input focused on
gathering information about current transportation usage patterns, existing
transportation network conditions, and priority factors for the future of
transportation.
