The Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area is a diverse region spanning approximately
47 square miles and containing a population of more than 145,000 people in
east-central Illinois. The region is located 135 miles south of Chicago,
Illinois, 120 miles west of Indianapolis, Indiana, and 180 miles northeast of
Saint Louis, Missouri. Five municipalities are partially or wholly within the
Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area: City of Champaign, City of Urbana, Village of
Savoy, Village of Tolono, and Village of Bondville. In contrast, the
Metropolitan Planning Area (MPA) is the 25-year planning area for the long range
transportation plan. The MPA spans 179 square miles and includes the
Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area as well as the Village of Mahomet and some rural
areas of Champaign County. The MPA is used to determine which areas will develop
in a contiguous manner to the urbanized area over the next 25 years.

Some general characteristics of each of the municipalities within the MPA are
provided in the table below. From 2010 to 2015, Savoy, Bondville, and
Mahomet experienced the greatest changes in population with increases of 10.8%, 7.4%, and
6.9%, respectively. Total land area generally remained the same or
increased modestly for most of the municipalities within the MPA. The greatest
change in land area occurred in Urbana and Mahomet, with about 2% increases for
both.
