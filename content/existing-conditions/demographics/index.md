The Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area is a diverse region spanning approximately
47 square miles and containing a population of more than 148,000 people in
east-central Illinois. The region is located 135 miles south of Chicago,
Illinois, 120 miles west of Indianapolis, Indiana, and 180 miles northeast of
Saint Louis, Missouri. Five municipalities are partially or wholly within the
Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area: City of Champaign, City of Urbana, Village of
Savoy, Village of Tolono, and Village of Bondville. In contrast, the
Metropolitan Planning Area (MPA) is the 25-year planning area for the long range
transportation plan. The MPA spans 179 square miles and includes the
Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area as well as the Village of Mahomet and some rural
areas of Champaign County. The MPA is used to determine which areas will develop
in a contiguous manner to the urbanized area over the next 25 years.

General characteristics of each municipality within the MPA are provided in the
table below. From the 2010 to 2015 American Community Survey (ACS), Savoy,
Bondville, and Mahomet experienced the greatest changes in population with
increases of 10.8, 7.4, and 6.9 percent, respectively. Total land area generally
remained the same or increased modestly for most municipalities within the MPA.
The greatest change in land area occurred in Urbana and Mahomet, with about two
percent increases for both.

## Age and Gender ##

In larger populations, the ratio of men to women approaches one-to-one, or
approximately 50 percent males to 50 percent females. Data refined from
the 2015 ACS estimates a nearly balanced ratio of males to females in overall
U.S. population, with 0.4 percent more females than males. In Champaign, Urbana,
and Bondville, gender equilibrium closely parallels the national ratio. Gender
equilibrium is less balanced within the remaining MPA municipalities. A greater
percentage of females live in Savoy and Mahomet, and approximately 6.5 percent
more males than females live in Tolono.

Based on data from the 2015 ACS, the largest shift away from the national age
distribution occurred in the percentage of college-aged adults within Champaign
and Urbana. Adults between 18 to 24 years of age comprised 30 percent more of
the Urbana population than the national population due the substantial
University of Illinois student population. In Mahomet and Tolono, youth
distribution deviated over the national baseline by more than five percent.
Youth distribution in Champaign, Urbana, Savoy, and Bondville were below the
national percentage by 3 to 11 percent. Savoy’s percentage of adults 65 years
and over doubled in comparison to the percentages of older adults living in
Champaign and Urbana. With the exception of Savoy, municipalities within the MPA
had about two to eight percent fewer older adults relative to their total
populations than the percentages at the national level.

## People with Disabilities ##

Within the MPA, people with disabilities range from 7 to 15 percent of the each
municipality’s total population. Bondville’s percentage of people with
disabilities is the highest of all the MPA municipalities, exceeding the next
highest municipality’s rate by about four percent. Notably, the percentage of
people with disabilities in Bondville is above the national percentages for all
age groups and has approximately twice the percentage of adults age 18 to 64
with disabilities than the other MPA municipalities. Savoy has the largest
percentage of adults over the age of 65 with a disability at over 40 percent of
the population, followed by Tolono and Mahomet.

## Race and Ethnicity ##

Although the white population continues to decrease in percentage, the
Champaign-Urbana MPA still has a predominantly white population. The majority of
racial diversity is located in Champaign, Urbana, and Savoy. The percentage of
minority racial groups in these municipalities tends to be about 25 percent
higher than those in Tolono, Bondville, and Mahomet. The Hispanic or Latino
population is more uniformly distributed within each of the MPA municipalities,
with a range of 3.2 percent of the population in Mahomet to 6.7 percent in
Tolono. From the 2010 to 2015 ACS, the percentage of minority populations
decreased in Savoy and Mahomet while it increased in the other MPA
municipalities. The Asian population rose by about two percent in Champaign,
Urbana, and Savoy. Bondville and Tolono experienced the most significant
increases in both the black or African American population and the Hispanic or
Latino population.

## Income and Poverty ##

Within the MPA, Urbana and Champaign have the highest percentages of people
living in poverty, as measured by a low income to poverty ratio. The income to
poverty ratio determines the extent to which a household’s income is above or
below the poverty threshold. An income to poverty ratio of less than one
corresponds with a household income below the poverty threshold, and an income
to poverty ratio of less than 0.50 represents a household income at less than
50 percent of the poverty threshold. In the ACS data collected between 2010
and 2015, about a quarter of Urbana residents and nearly 20 percent of
Champaign residents subsisted on income below half of the poverty threshold.
Mahomet residents experienced the most freedom from poverty, and Tolono was the
only municipality with none of its population in the most severe range of
poverty.

The population living in poverty has generally increased within the MPA
municipalities during the years between the 2010 and 2015 ACS. Urbana and Savoy
experienced the most significant increases in the percentage of the population
living in poverty. Despite the rising poverty rates, Tolono and Mahomet still
witnessed poverty rates at about half the national level. Poverty rates in Savoy
and Bondville were most comparable to the national level. Champaign and
Urbana exceeded the national poverty rates by about 13 and 19 percent, respectively.

Zero vehicle households increased in percentage between the 2010 and 2015 ACS
for the following MPA municipalities: Champaign, Urbana, Bondville, and Mahomet.
More than 8,000 households, or approximately 14 percent of households within the
urbanized area, had no access to motor vehicles. Mahomet and Urbana experienced
the most significant decreases in access to motor vehicles. Approximately 21
percent of Urbana households do not own a motor vehicle, representing a three
percent increase from the 2010 ACS. Similarly, the percentage of households
without any motor vehicle in Mahomet more than doubled, representing more than a
three percent increase.

## Population Distribution and Density ##

The urbanized area grew from 123,938 people in 2000 to 145,361 people in 2010.
The urbanized area also grew by more than eight square miles from 2000 to 2010
with a continued trend of nearly three-percent shift from rural to urban land
designation per decade in Champaign County from 1980 to 2010. Changes in the
urbanized area boundary occur every ten years in conjugation with the decennial
census. Since the last LRTP update, there have been no updates to the urbanized
area boundary as a result of being between decennial censuses.

## Employment ##

Champaign County is a regional center because of the presence of education,
health care, and manufacturing employers in the area. According to the Illinois
Department of Employment Security (IDES), the unemployment rate decreased from
an average of 7.8 to 5.1 percent during the period between 2011 and 2016. The
labor force during this same time period decreased by 472 workers. The Census
Bureau’s Quarterly Workforce Indicators identified the following top five
employments sectors for Champaign County in 2016:

1. Educational Services, 19,070 workers
2. Health Care and Social Assistance,12,871 workers
3. Accommodation and Food Services, 9,423 workers
4. Retail Trade, 8,490 workers
5. Manufacturing, 7,196 workers

Since 2011, many of the top employers within Champaign County have lost a
significant number of employees. With the exception of the University of
Illinois which experienced a growth of 3,313 employees, Champaign County’s top
ten employers lost over 900 employees from 2011 and 2016. Interestingly, the
large increase in the University of Illinois employees did not correlate to a
significant impact on the number of workers in educational services for
Champaign County during the same time period. The health care and social
assistance sector had the greatest growth, followed by the accommodation and
food services sector.
