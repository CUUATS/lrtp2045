The Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area is a diverse region spanning approximately
47 square miles and containing a population of more than 148,000 people in
east-central Illinois. The region is located 135 miles south of Chicago,
Illinois, 120 miles west of Indianapolis, Indiana, and 180 miles northeast of
Saint Louis, Missouri. Five municipalities are partially or wholly within the
Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area: City of Champaign, City of Urbana, Village of
Savoy, Village of Tolono, and Village of Bondville. In contrast, the
Metropolitan Planning Area (MPA) is the 25-year planning area for the long range
transportation plan. The MPA spans 179 square miles and includes the
Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area as well as the Village of Mahomet and some rural
areas of Champaign County. The MPA is used to determine which areas will develop
in a contiguous manner to the urbanized area over the next 25 years.

Some general characteristics of each of the municipalities within the MPA are
provided in the table below. From 2010 to 2015, Savoy, Bondville, and
Mahomet experienced the greatest changes in population with increases of 10.8%, 7.4%, and
6.9%, respectively. Total land area generally remained the same or
increased modestly for most of the municipalities within the MPA. The greatest
change in land area occurred in Urbana and Mahomet, with about 2% increases for
both.

## Age and Gender ##

In larger populations, the ratio of men to women approaches one-to-one, or
approximately fifty percent males to fifty percent females. Data refined from
the 2015 American Community Survey estimates a nearly balanced ratio of males to
females in overall U.S. population, with 0.4% more females than males. In
Champaign, Urbana, and Bondville, gender equilibrium closely parallels the
national ratio. For the remaining MPA municipalities, a more unbalanced gender
ratio exists. A greater percentage of females live in Savoy and Mahomet, and
approximately 6.5% more men reside in Tolono.

In 2015, more than 8,000 households, or approximately fourteen percent of
households within the urbanized area, had no access to motor vehicles. From 2010
to 2015, all municipalities within the MPA witnessed an increase in the total
combined percentage of zero vehicle households and households with limited
access to a motor vehicle, except Savoy. Urbana and Champaign have the highest
percentages of households with limited access to a motor vehicle. Approximately
forty percent of Urbana households and thirty percent of Champaign households do
not own a motor vehicle, or live in households with limited access to a motor
vehicle. Mahomet has experienced the most significant decrease in access to
motor vehicles. The percentage of households without any motor vehicle in
Mahomet more than doubled between 2010 and 2015, meanwhile the percentage of
households with only limited access to vehicles also increased by about two
percent.
