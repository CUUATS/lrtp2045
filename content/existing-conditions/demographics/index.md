The Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area is a diverse region spanning approximately
47 square miles and containing a population of more than 148,000 people in
east-central Illinois. The region is located 135 miles south of Chicago,
Illinois, 120 miles west of Indianapolis, Indiana, and 180 miles northeast of
Saint Louis, Missouri. Five municipalities are partially or wholly within the
Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area: City of Champaign, City of Urbana, Village of
Savoy, Village of Tolono, and Village of Bondville. In contrast, the
Metropolitan Planning Area (MPA) is the 25-year planning area for the long range
transportation plan. The MPA spans 179 square miles and includes the
Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area as well as the Village of Mahomet and some rural
areas of Champaign County. The MPA is used to determine which areas will develop
in a contiguous manner to the urbanized area over the next 25 years.

General characteristics of each municipality within the MPA are provided in the
table below. From 2010 to 2015, Savoy, Bondville, and Mahomet experienced the
greatest changes in population with increases of 10.8%, 7.4%, and 6.9%,
respectively. Total land area generally remained the same or increased modestly
for most of the municipalities within the MPA. The greatest change in land area
occurred in Urbana and Mahomet, with about 2% increases for both.

## Age and Gender ##

In larger populations, the ratio of men to women approaches one-to-one, or
approximately fifty percent males to fifty percent females. Data refined from
the 2015 American Community Survey estimates a nearly balanced ratio of males to
females in overall U.S. population, with 0.4% more females than males. In
Champaign, Urbana, and Bondville, gender equilibrium closely parallels the
national ratio. For the remaining MPA municipalities, a more unbalanced gender
ratio exists. A greater percentage of females live in Savoy and Mahomet, and
approximately 6.5% more men reside in Tolono.

Based on data from the 2015 American Community Survey, the largest shift away
from the national age distribution occurred in the percentage of college-aged
adults within Champaign and Urbana. Adults between eighteen to twenty-four years
old comprised thirty percent more of the Urbana population than the national
population due the substantial University of Illinois student population. In
Mahomet and Tolono, youth distribution deviated by more than five percent over
the national baseline. Youth distribution in Champaign, Urbana, Savoy, and
Bondville were below the national percentage by three to eleven percent. Savoy’s
percentage of adults sixty-five years and older doubled in comparison to the
percentages of older adults living in Champaign and Urbana. With the exception
of Savoy, municipalities within the MPA had about two to eight percent fewer
older adults relative to their total populations than the percentages at the
national level.

## People with Disabilities ##

Within the MPA, people with disabilities range from seven to fifteen percent of
the each municipality’s total population. Bondville’s percentage of people with
disabilities is the highest of all the MPA municipalities, exceeding the next
highest municipality’s rate by about four percent. Notably, the percentage of
people with disabilities in Bondville is above the national percentages for all
age groups and has approximately twice the percentage of adults age eighteen to
sixty-four with disabilities than the other MPA municipalities. Savoy has the
largest percentage of adults over the age of sixty-five with a disability at
over forty percent of the population, followed by Tolono and Mahomet.

## Race and Ethnicity ##

Although the white population continues to decrease in percentage, the
Champaign-Urbana MPA still has a predominantly white population. The most racial
diversity is located in Champaign, Urbana, and Savoy. At approximately five to
seven percent of the population, the Hispanic or Latino population is more
uniformly distributed than racial groups within the MPA. From 2010 to 2015, the
percentage of minority populations decreased in Savoy and Mahomet while it
increased in the other MPA municipalities. The Asian population rose by about
two percent in Champaign, Urbana, and Savoy. Bondville and Tolono experienced
the most significant increases in both the black or African American population
and the Hispanic or Latino population.

## Income and Poverty ##

Within the MPA, Urbana and Champaign have the highest percentages of the
lowest income to poverty ratios. The income to poverty ratio determines the
extent to which a household’s income is above or below the poverty threshold. An
income to poverty ratio of 0.99 or less corresponds with a household income
below the poverty threshold, and an income to poverty ratio of less than 0.50
represents a household income at less than fifty percent of the poverty
threshold. In the ACS data collected between 2010 and 2015, more than a quarter
of the residents within Urbana and Champaign subsist on income below half of the
poverty threshold. Mahomet residents have experienced the most freedom from
poverty, and Tolono was the only municipality with none of its population at an
income to poverty ratio below half of the poverty threshold.

During the last five years, the population living in poverty has generally
increased in the MPA municipalities. Urbana and Savoy experienced the most
significant increases in the percentage of the population living in poverty.
Despite the rising poverty rates, Tolono and Mahomet still witnessed poverty
rates at about half the national level. Poverty rates in Savoy and Bondville
were most comparative to the national level, and Champaign and Urbana exceeded
the national poverty rates by about 13% and 19%, respectively.

From 2010 to 2015, all municipalities within the MPA witnessed an increase in
the total combined percentage of zero vehicle households and households with
limited access to a motor vehicle, except Savoy. More than 8,000 households, or
approximately fourteen percent of households within the urbanized area, had no
access to motor vehicles. Urbana and Champaign have the highest percentages of
households with limited access to a motor vehicle. Approximately forty percent
of Urbana households and thirty percent of Champaign households do not own a
motor vehicle, or live in households with limited access to a motor vehicle.
Mahomet has experienced the most significant decrease in access to motor
vehicles. The percentage of households without any motor vehicle in Mahomet more
than doubled between 2010 and 2015, meanwhile the percentage of households with
only limited access to vehicles also increased by about two percent.
